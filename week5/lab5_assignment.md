# Lab: Week 5

For this lab, you will be writing a Python script that defines a new function and runs it. Just like you did for last week's lab, write the script in **main.py** and then after you download the REPL to your computer, change the name of that file on your computer before uploading to Moodle.

**Scenario:** It's the year 2438. You are a scientist on Ganymede, a moon of Jupiter. You are studying rock samples from Ganymede, and you hired a field technician to collect rock samples, weigh them, and record their mass. Unfortunately, the field tech recorded the mass data in the wrong units; they used **trefnos**, but you need the mass in **blorvimas**.

In your Python script, do the following:

1. Define a new function named <code>trefnos_to_blorvimas</code> that takes one argument (a floating point number) and does the following:
	1. Converts **trefnos** to **blorvimas**
		- There are 56.281 blorvimas in 1 trefno.
		- Therefore, given a number in trefnos, multiply it by 56.281 to convert to blorvimas.
	2. Prints the result to the screen, rounded to the nearest blorvima.

2. Run the <code>trefnos_to_blorvimas</code> function with the first data point collected by your tech: 32.519 trefnos.


Downloading & Submitting
- Download your REPL and unzip.
- Find the file main.py, which is your script for this assignment. Rename that file to lastname_lab5.py but replacing "lastname" with your last name.
- Upload only the lastname_lab5.py file to Moodle for this assignment.
- On your computer, save your script with your other lab files, but you can delete the rest of this REPL download.
