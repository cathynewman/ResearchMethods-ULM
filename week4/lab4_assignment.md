# Lab: Week 4

For this lab, you will create a Python script. The easiest way to do this in REPL is to just write the script in **main.py** and then after you download the REPL to your computer, you can change the name of that file on your computer before uploading to Moodle (see detailed instructions below).

Create a Python script that does the following:

1. Prompts the user to type in a DNA sequence in the command line.
2. Counts the number of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts in that DNA sequence and prints each count to the screen (number only, no other text).

Formatting Notes
- There are multiple ways to accomplish this task that all work the same. So your code probably won’t be exactly like your classmate's.
- Remember to comment your code. It’s especially critical to note in a comment the _order_ in which the nucleotide counts are printing, since the output will only be a list of 4 numbers.
- Keep in mind that the user (me) could input the DNA sequence using capital or lowercase letters. To make sure your code works, you’ll need to convert the user input to lowercase or uppercase, depending on which case you use in your <code>.count()</code> method.

Downloading & Submitting
- Download your REPL and unzip.
- Find the file **main.py**, which is your script for this assignment. Rename that file to **lastname_lab4.py** but replacing "lastname" with your last name.
	- MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT ACCIDENTALLY CHANGE THE FILENAME EXTENSION (it must stay .py).
- Upload only the **lastname_lab4.py** file to Moodle for this assignment.
- On your computer, save your script with your other lab files, but you can delete the rest of this REPL download.
